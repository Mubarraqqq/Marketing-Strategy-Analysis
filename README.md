# Marketing-Strategy-Analysis

Analysis of a dataset containing customer sales and demographic information which aids in identifying trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can help improve marketing strategies. 

- This was a task assignment given to me during the final stage of a Data Analyst job interview. This was to assess my technical skills and abilities toward the real-life application of my data skillset.
 * NB: I got the role! :)
